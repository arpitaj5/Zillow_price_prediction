# Zillow_price_prediction
This project aims for predicting the cost of house using Zillow's housing data.  

After performing EDA on over 80 features we built OLS, Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net models using R for price prediction. With a keen eye on model assumption we performed feature selection and examined for multicolinearity.  

The datasets used for modeling can be found [https://github.com/arpitaj5/Zillow_price_prediction/tree/master/Data](here) along with the data description.  
You can find the code [https://github.com/arpitaj5/Zillow_price_prediction/blob/master/Prediction.Rmd](here) and for details on all the methodologies please refer the [https://github.com/arpitaj5/Zillow_price_prediction/blob/master/Report.pdf](business report).

Below I present a few EDAs done on the data set.
